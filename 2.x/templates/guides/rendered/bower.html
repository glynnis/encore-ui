<h3  id="bower-publishing">Bower Publishing</h3><p>EncoreUI is published through Bower so that it can be installed locally as a Bower dependency. This is an alternative to the normal CDN installation route.</p>
<p>In order to avoid cluttering up PR&#39;s with build files, all Bower build files are hosted <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui-bower/">in a separate &#39;EncoreUI Bower&#39; repo</a>. This repo is what&#39;s registered with Bower, so it must be updated on every release of EncoreUI.</p>
<p>Updates to this repo have been automated through the <code>grunt shipit</code> command. When <code>shipit</code> is run, it builds all relevant files, pushes to the public CDN, but also build the corresponding files for Bower and pushes a new version to this separate repo. You must have push privileges to run this.</p>
<h3  id="note">Note</h3><p>Ideally, this would all be handled within the same repo and no separate push to bower would have to take place. This should be investigated further as time permits. A good starting point is <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/angular-ui-publisher">Angular UI Publisher</a>.</p>
<h2 class="page-title" id="local-dev-with-bower-link">Local Dev with Bower Link</h2><p>If you find yourself working on an Encore app and need to work with an EncoreUI component that hasn&#39;t been released in an official version, you can use <code>bower link</code> to link a local install of EncoreUI (with the latest/greatest) with your app&#39;s bower directory.
