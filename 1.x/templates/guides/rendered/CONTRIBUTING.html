</ul>
</li>
<li>The EncoreUI team will create a JIRA story and add it to the current or future sprint.</li>
<li>The GitHub issue will remain open until addressed and before closed, will show steps taken by the EncoreUI team.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Issue:</strong> Please see a <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/issues/1465">reported issue</a> that walks through 
the steps of replicating, logging, tracking, and follow-up resolution with the reporter.  </p>
<h4  id="how-to-report-a-bug">How to Report a Bug</h4><ul>
<li>Open a new <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/issues">GitHub Issue</a>.</li>
<li>When reporting a bug, please provide:<ul>
<li><strong>steps to reproduce the bug</strong> (If an EncoreUI developer cannot reproduce it, it becomes much more difficult to 
fix.)</li>
<li>screenshots of the bug</li>
<li>operating environment (browser with version, OS, etc)</li>
<li>Framework version</li>
<li>rate the bug as minor or major</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The EncoreUI team will create a JIRA story and add it to the current or future sprint.</li>
<li>The GitHub issue will remain open until addressed and before closed, will show steps taken by the EncoreUI team.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example Bug:</strong>  Please see a <a href="https://github.com/rackerlabs/encore-ui/issues/1492">reported bug</a> 
that walks through the steps of reporting, logging, and resolving the reported bug.</p>
<h3  id="preparing-an-issue-for-development">Preparing an Issue for development</h3><p>When an Issue is ready to move to development, make sure it includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Link to Invision designs (if applicable)</li>
<li>Screenshot of final visual design</li>
<li>For new visual components or visual changes, sign-off from our designers is <em>required</em>. Mark issue with <code>Needs Design</code>
label to request input</li>
<li>When all technical discussion on the issue is complete, change the label to <code>Ready for Dev</code>. For visual 
components/changes, <em>only</em> a designer may make this change.</li>
</ul>
<h3  id="addingupdating-code">Adding/Updating Code</h3><p>If you plan on adding/updating code, please make sure you have first filed an issue, detailing why you think the update 
is necessary. This lets the EncoreUI team discuss the problem and potential solutions with you.
This also helps to ensure that separate teams are not trying to do the same thing simultaneously.</p>
<h3  id="pr-types">PR Types:</h3><p>The following types of Pull Requests are most commonly seen:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Components</li>
<li>DO NOT MERGE - Reserved for prototype work</li>
<li>Styles</li>
<li>Docs</li>
<li>Bug Fixes</li>
<li>Component Revisions - Update to the style or interaction</li>
<li>Deprecations</li>
</ul>
<p>The most complex PRs are usually &quot;New Components&quot;. The &quot;PR Steps&quot; below describe our criteria for putting together a 
new component PR. For the other types, adjust the steps as necessary, let common sense be your guide!</p>
<p>Currently, when adding a new component, our most precious resource is the time of our designers. To ensure that the PR 
process is as streamlined for them as possible, please make sure to follow the steps below.</p>
<h3  id="pr-steps">PR Steps</h3><ul>
<li><strong>Prerequisites</strong>:<ul>
<li>New Components <em>must</em> be created using our <a href="#/guides/ui-setup#creating-a-new-module">Component Scaffolding</a></li>

<li><strong>Step 8</strong>: Final Travis Build Verification</li>
<li><strong>Step 9</strong>: MERGE IT!</li>
</ul>
<h4  id="providing-pr-feedback">Providing PR Feedback</h4><p>There are certain things developers look for in PR Feedback, and certain items that can usually &quot;wait until later&quot;.</p>
<h5  id="requested-feedback">Requested Feedback</h5><ul>
<li>CSS Best Practices (ie: LESS variables)</li>
<li>JavaScript / Angular Best Practices</li>
<li>Maintainability of the Code Base</li>
<li>JavaScript Documentation</li>
<li>Test Coverage Validation</li>
</ul>
<h5  id="nonrequested-feedback">Non-Requested Feedback</h5><p>Create an issue for non-requested feedback &amp; tag with types, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>visual design</li>
<li>architecture</li>
<li>feature request</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Topics outside of the scope of the PR should be left for later. If a component already has design sign-off, the PR is 
not the place to question the design or ask for design changes</p>
<h4  id="get-feedback-early-and-often">Get feedback early and often</h4><p>It is much better to ask for feedback on an unfinished idea than to receive feedback on a finished one. If you are 
developing a new component, or updating an old one, feel free to post code as you write it. But please add 
&quot;DO NOT MERGE&quot; to the title of the PR, to let people know it is not quite ready.</p>
<h4  id="request-a-check-for-color-contrast-with-tota11y">Request a check for color contrast with Tota11y</h4><p>Another point of feedback a hybrid or designer may provide on a pull request concerns color contrast. Patterns in the 
Framework have been carefully vetted by designers for adequate color contrast to comply with a11y standards for 
accessibility. To confirm that ratios of color contrast for critical text comply with standards, we use 
<a href="http://khan.github.io/tota11y/">Tota11y</a>, a bookmarklet tool that can be run in a development environment. To 
demonstrate that a new feature or design complies, post an additional screen shot with Tota11y contrast ratios showing 
along with the usual &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; screen shots. When contrast is adequate, all checks on the page that Tota11y 
provides should show as green, with a ratio of 4.5 or higher.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="http://khan.github.io/tota11y/">http://khan.github.io/tota11y/</a> and follow the installation option for dragging
the tota11y button to your bookmarks bar.</li>
<li>Load your browser with the application/environment that displays the page before any code or color changes.</li>
<li>Click the tota11y bookmark on your browser bar.</li>
<li>Click the icon at the bottom of your screen that looks like a set of eye glasses.</li>
<li>Click the &quot;Contrast&quot; option from the menu that appears.</li>
<li>Take a screenshot of the page/section that displays the desired area you are focused on.</li>
<li>Load your browser with the application/environment that displays the page after any code or color changes.</li>
<li>Click the icon at the bottom of your screen that looks like a set of eye glasses.</li>
<li>Click the &quot;Contrast&quot; option from the menu that appears.</li>
<li>Take a screenshot of the page/section that displays the desired area you are focused on.</li>
<li>Save the &quot;Before&quot; and &quot;After&quot; images on your computer.</li>
<li>Submit your Pull Request to the appropriate github repository.</li>
<li>Include the &quot;Before&quot; and &quot;After&quot; images in your initial comment of the Pull Request.</li>
<li>Include a small description of the initial problem and solution displayed in the images. Including before and after 
shots show the contrast ratio improvements clearly to those reviewing your pull request.</li>
</ul>
<h3  id="how-to-review-pull-requests-for-design">How to Review Pull Requests for Design</h3><p>Even when mock-ups are provided, minor discrepancies and inconsistencies may creep into pull requests
as developers make their best guess at the designer&#39;s intent. Translating mock-ups and visuals into
precise measurements and class names in code can be tricky. If you are submitting a pull request to the
Framework, or if your project consumes the Framework and your team includes designers or hybrids,
require a &quot;Design LGTM&quot; before merge on each pull request that involves changes to the interface, HTML mark-up,
or CSS.</p>
<p>Design LGTMs can only be given by people in a traditional design role, or by hybrids that do design and
development. However, adopting similar review methods on teams without designers or hybrids is advisable,
but may be tricky depending on your team&#39;s experience and eye for design and small visual discrepancies.</p>
<p>An initial design mockup should be referenced during review. This is usually documented in the initial
JIRA story, or may be a link to InVision. If additional specs are needed, then please obtain additional
feedback from the initial designer. Most common patterns and UI elements can be referenced in the framework Style Guide.</p>
<p>When reviewing a pull request for design, designers and hybrids look to see that the screenshots provided
on a pull request are as close to mock-ups as can be reasonably expected. Common areas to check include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text size and decoration<ul>
<li>Is text underlined where it should be? Is text size using the same proportions the mock-up indicated?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Color usage<ul>
<li>Did the developer use colors provided by 
<a href="http://rackerlabs.github.io/encore-ui/#/styles/color">the Framework&#39;s color palette</a>, rather than sampling
colors or introducing new hex codes?</li>
<li>Is color contrast compliant with A11y standards 
(<a href="" ng-click="vm.scrollTo('using-tota11y-to-check-for-adequate-contrast')">see &quot;Request a check for color contrast with Tota11y&quot; above</a>)?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Margins and padding</li>
<li>Proper usage of layout guidelines and any other patterns and standards provided by the Framework</li>
<li>Consistency with similar elements or pages within the same application or within the Encore ecosystem<ul>
<li>Even when mock-ups are implemented and the screenshots match, there&#39;s still a possibility that the new work 
doesn&#39;t match existing precedents that have already been coded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When hybrids review a pull request, they may be able to provide additional feedback, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Were the correct classes used in conjunction with mark-up?</li>
<li>Does the mark-up match the order and execution outlined for patterns in the Framework?</li>
<li>Were any edits or changes to CSS made that were unnecessary (like creating properties we already have a class for)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some feedback or suggestions can be put off and covered in a separate pull request 
(<a href="" ng-click="vm.scrollTo('non-requested-feedback')">see &quot;Non-Requested Feedback&quot; above</a>).</p>

<h3  id="code-contribution-process">Code Contribution Process</h3><p>The process for any code updates follows <a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html">the GitHub Flow model</a>.</p>
<p>To sum up:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new branch in your local repo</li>
<li>Commit to that branch</li>
<li>Push branch up to Github</li>
<li>Submit PR for review (according to guidelines above)</li>
<li>Once reviewed and feedback given (and implemented), an EncoreUI developer will merge the branch to master</li>
</ol>
<h3  id="3rdparty-libraries">3rd-party Libraries</h3><p>Any libraries added to the project must be pre-approved with the UI team.</p>
<h3  id="tips-on-committing-your-code">Tips on Committing Your Code</h3><h4  id="update-your-gitconfig-to-only-push-the-current-branch">Update your .gitconfig to only push the current branch</h4><p>Ensure that you have the following in your <code>.gitconfig</code>.</p>
<pre><code>[push]
    default = current
</code></pre><p>You can add the above lines to your <code>.gitconfig</code> if they are not present, or run the following command in your terminal:</p>
<p><code>git config --global push.default current</code></p>
<h4  id="diff-before-every-commit">Diff Before Every Commit</h4><p>Get into the habit of running <code>git diff</code> or <code>git diff --cached</code> before every commit. This helps ensure that no unwanted 
changes sneak in. Also, check for unnecessary whitespace with <code>git diff --check</code>.</p>
<h4  id="commits-should-be-granular">Commits Should Be Granular</h4><p>You should keep each commit as granular as possible. For instance, do not check in 2 bug fixes in one commit -- separate
them out into 2 commits.</p>
<h4  id="commits-follow-a-common-format">Commits Follow a Common Format</h4><p>Commit messages adhere to the Angular 
<a href="https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format">commit message format</a>. Any 
commits that do not follow this format will be rejected.</p>
<h3  id="testing">Testing</h3><ul>
<li>Run <em>all</em> the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.</li>
<li>Meet or exceed a minimum Unit Test coverage of 80%<ul>
<li>simple controllers/services may not need to be unit tested, depending on their complexity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Midway tests need to be created for any new component</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#/guides/testing">More on testing</a></p>
<h3  id="submitting-changes">Submitting changes</h3><p>Before submitting any changes, make sure the master branch is merged locally into your branch 
(using <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing">Git rebase</a> is preferred). Once done, push your branch up 
to Github and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">submit a Pull Request</a>.</p>
<h3  id="design-review-of-pull-requests">Design Review of Pull Requests</h3><p>Many times, pull requests will touch resources that render visually. These are still changes that must be reviewed! For 
the sake of simplicity and transparency, it is the responsibility of the author of a pull request to also include a 
comment containing screenshots of the visual changes. Here is an example of a typical pull request workflow containing 
designer feedback and sign off.</p>
<ol>
<li>A pull request author finishes some new feature that contains visual changes <em>already mocked-up and approved by 
design</em>.</li>
<li>The pull request author gathers the appropriate &quot;before&quot; (master branch, usually) and &quot;after&quot; screenshots of each 
relevant section.</li>
<li>A pull request is created.</li>
<li>A comment is created <a href="https://github.com/blog/821">that tags an EncoreUI designer</a>. Immediately below this &quot;@&quot; 
mention, the screenshots are <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/issue-attachments/">uploaded in the comment interface</a>.</li>
<li>The initial visual feedback suggestion from our team recommends changing something so it better complies with 
original mock-ups they provided. This change would require new screenshots!</li>
<li>The pull request author changes something about the visual aspect of the design. They capture the new, changed 
screenshots (the original ones remain unchanged).</li>
<li>New screenshots are added, exactly how they were outlined above. Copy any pre-existing &quot;before&quot; screenshots from 
the old screenshot collection. Tag the designer reviewing this pull request.</li>
<li>Previous screenshots are edited to no longer render inline. This prevents confusion while retaining accurate 
historical records of visual feedback during review.</li>
</ol>
<h4  id="editing-previous-screenshots">Editing previous screenshots</h4><p>Here is an example of how you should edit the old screenshot comments to change them from inline rendered to 
non-rendered.</p>
<p><strong>Before:</strong> Used to render inline.</p>
<pre><code>![I heard you like screenshots in github](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1214609/7869834/dcd3cada-054a-11e5-9f4f-79d35d1153db.jpg)
</code></pre><p><strong>After:</strong> Will no longer render inline.</p>
<pre><code>[Outdated screenshot.](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1214609/7869834/dcd3cada-054a-11e5-9f4f-79d35d1153db.jpg)
</code></pre><h3  id="finalizing-a-pull-request">Finalizing a Pull Request</h3><p>Occasionally a PR will receive comments and/or requests for changes before it is merged in. These changes should be 
submitted as new commits on the existing PR.</p>
<p>Once EncoreUI developers are happy with the final state of the PR, they will write &quot;LGTM&quot; or &quot;Looks good to me&quot; as a 
comment, and ask that you squash all of your commits down into one or two.</p>
<h4  id="squashing-commits">Squashing Commits</h4><p>Commits are normally squashed as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>git rebase -i HEAD~x</code> where x is the number of commits you have made on the branch/PR (The &quot;Commits&quot; tab on the PR 
page will display how many commits have been made)</li>
<li>Not including your original commit, mark <code>f</code>/<code>fixup</code> or <code>s</code>/<code>squash</code> for all commits after 
it (<a href="" ng-click="vm.scrollTo('example-of-step-2')">see example that follows</a>)</li>
<li>Update the latest master and do <code>git rebase master</code> on your branch, now that everything has been summed up into one 
or two commits<ol>
<li>You may run into a merge conflict. In that case, open the conflicting file(s) and modify them so that they reflect 
the desired final state.</li>
<li><code>git add &lt;filename&gt;</code> will include the corrected file into the rebase</li>
<li><code>git rebase --continue</code> will conclude the rebase now that the conflict has been resolved</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><code>git push -f origin &lt;branch_name&gt;</code> to force push your branch up to Github. <em>Please do not push to master branch.</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Once Travis completes the tests on the rebased branch, the PR will be merged by an EncoreUI developer.</p>
<h5  id="example-of-step-2">Example of Step 2</h5><pre><code>pick 3564c3f feat(rxApp): the first of your PR commits with a good commit message
